To parse language models also into an ontology 
instead of only an EMF resource using OWLText do the following:

* Add a dependency of your language resource plug-in to org.emftext.runtime.owltext
  (use either the following option in your .cs file: 
   additionalDependencies="org.emftext.runtime.owltext"; 
   or be sure not to override the Manifest.MF during parser generation)
* Adapt the .genmodel for the language:
 * Model > Feature Delegation: Reflective
 * Model > Minimal Reflective Methods: True
 * Model Class Defaults > Root Extends Class: org.emftext.runtime.owltext.OWLTextEObjectImpl
* Regenerate the model code 
* Provide an OWL-based representation besides the language metamodel that 
  every OWL-based language model will import and refer to (will be 
  automated using a model transformation)
