To parse language models also into an ontology 
instead of only an EMF resource using OWLText do the following:

* add a dependency of your language plug-in to org.emftext.runtime.owltext
(be sure not to override the Manifest.MF during parser generation)
* adapt the .genmodel for the language:
 * Model > Feature Delegation: Reflective
 * Model > Minimal Reflecitve Methods: True
 * Model Class Defaults > Root Extends Class: org.emftext.runtime.owltext.OWLTextEObjectImpl
* Regenerate the model code 
* Provide an OWL-based representation besides the language metamodel that 
every OWL-based language model will import and refer to (will be 
automated using a model tranformation)
